excerpt: Why I'm still out of X.
---

I was active on Twitter (now X, and I still can't get over it) for about ten years, from 2010 to 2022. I was on an off at times, but for the most part I was relatively active and I met great academics and collaborators with whom I remain in touch to this day. Just like everybody, I also had my bad moments and painful discussions, like being tweet-quoted as "an embarrassment in Colombian philosophical academia". Overall, though, I had a great time on Twitter. But I don't miss it at all.

The reasons to be out of Twitter are now well-known and hardly deserve repeating. This is also because, a year after the "exodus", people have already made their choices clear. Those who remain in the platform know why they are there, and know that they are there in spite of Elon Musk and bullies and all the bad things that people love to hate about it. It is where their circles are, and just like moving bars late in the night, many find it better to have one last drink at the current place than move to a new location and risk losing someone in the group.

On the other side, those who left Twitter for good also know why they did it. In my case, I'm happy on Mastodon. And while I do think there are good political reasons to be on Mastodon (at the very least to support free software instead of corporate social media), I also don't want to be preachy about it. In the end, social media is about the _social_ aspect, and if the crowd in some place is not your crowd, it is reasonable not to be there at all. To me, Mastodon does offer interesting people to learn from, and as a bit of a Linux geek, it is a great place to be.

I feel sad that the academic crowd I once found on Twitter is fragmenting, though, and I hope there are spaces to meet again in the future. Especially as an academic in the Global South (and now in the very south!), I struggle to meet fellow academics face to face. Maybe I'll come back to Twitter, if some miracle happens. Or maybe some other thing will come and we'll all meet there. For now, come find me on Mastodon!
